# Lore Master
Hollow Knight Mod that adds abilities to the lore tablets and certain NPC. (Requires ItemChanger, MenuChanger and SFCore)

## How it works
Reading a lore tablet/talking to a npc displays the granted power name and a mostly vaguely description of what it does (or detailed description). The ability stays only active while you are in the zone, in which you found the lore tablet. If you have found all lore tablets in the zone, the powers are granted permanently. (Default)

## What does count?
I mostly oriented on the wiki page of lore tablets to see what actually counts. But there are a few addition, changes and removals to look out for:
- Menderbugs diary does grant an ability (does not require killing Menderbug)
- Any of Bretta's diary entries does count for her power.
- Midwife and the mask maker grant abilities.
- The traitor's grave, Moss prophet and the queen grant abilites.
- Bardoon grant an ability.
- The journal entry at the end of PoP grant an ability (This is the only power that by default is excluded (see below for more details))
- The world sense tablet in the black egg temple does count.
- Willoh grants an ability.
- Myla grants an ability. (Myla doesn't disappear)
- Quirrel in Crystal Peaks grants an ability. (Always present)
- Emilitia in the city grants a power.
- The statue of the Hollow Knight in the city grants a ability.
- All ghosts outside glade except Cloth and the dream warriors grant abilities.
- Record Bela grants an ability (extra lore tablet)
- Zote in Deepnest grant an ability
- Tiso at Blue Lake grant an ability

Currently not implemented:
- The shield on iselda's shop grants you a bonus but not ability. (Is not required for the dirtmouth loremaster)
- All Dream Warrior statues grant a bonus (not required).
- Elderbug grants the final power. (requires all other)

## Settings
You can change these options in the mod menu ingame:
- Custom Text: Some text lines can be replaced with own ones, to make it more fitting for the ability.
- Power Description: Determines if the powers should be descripted vaguely or precise.
- Disable yellow mushroom: If on, the yellow mushroom effect of the Bag of Mushroom ability will be disabled (Replaced with just a very very small soul gain).
- Allow Bomb Quickcast: If on, the bomb spell from "Grass Bombardement" can be cast via quick cast. If you want to do fireball skips it is recommended to turn this off.

## Extra Mode
This mode does modify the game a bit:
- Adds a "quest chain" to Elderbug.
- You cannot interact with lore tablets nor NPC (besides Elderbug and one other character). These abilities will be unlocked by the Elderbug quest chain.
- Allows you to change the requirement for opening the Black egg temple to obtaining certain amount of lore or lore + dreamers.
- **Hard and Heroic mode**: Will apply negative effects from lore powers which you haven't obtained yet. In heroic mode the positive effects are removed completely, you can just get rid of the negative onces.

## Inventory Page
Talking to Elderbug (or if randomized, finding the item) gives you access to the lore power inventory page in which you can see the hints/descriptions of the powers again and toggle them on/off while sitting on a bench.

- If the power shows a lore tablet image, you have obtained this power and it is active.
- If the power shows a red "x", you have obtained this power but it is disabled. (Through you or because you don't have the ability unlocked in the zone)
- If the power shows a gray "x", the power tag is "remove" which means the power doesn't work. After obtaining the power you can still activate it.
- If the power shows the dot, you haven't obtained the power yet.

If the power name is green you have global access to the power.

## Randomizer Use

This mods adds over 80 new possible locations to the randomizer. For more details what each setting does, look in the RandoReadme.

## Manual Setup

You also can set up a predefined pack of abilites or changing their tag. For this, create a options_{FileSlot}.txt file (options_1.txt for example) in the loremaster folder of the game. A default option file in added to the package.
Write %Override% or %Modify% in the first line:
Override: Will reset your progress and let's you start with only your configuration.
Modify: Loads the save data from the file and then modify the data with your configuration.

Write the name of a power like %MyPower% and add an tag behind it. E. g:
```
%WellFocused% global
%GreaterMind% disable
```
You can use the name of the power displayed in game or the name of the class from the code (Excluding the "Power" text. e.g: WeDontTalkAboutShadePower -> WeDontTalkAboutShade in the file.)

You have five tags available:
- global: This power is always available once obtained.
- local: Default behaviour, granted in the zone or globally if you have all required power in the zone.
- exclude: This power is granted like normal, but is not required to get the lore master of the zone. Same conditions as local for staying active.
- disable: This power doesn't work, but it's collection still behave normally.
- remove: This power doesn't work and is not required to get the lore master of the zone.

If you want to give yourself the power instantly, you can add "|add" to the end of the line. Note, that this power will be still affected by the tag. So if you give you an ability with the local tag, it will only be available in the zone where it would normally be (or globally if you have all required in the zone).

A option file can look like this:
```
%Override%
%Imposter% global
%UnitedWeStand% global | add
%ScrewTheRules% disable
%True Form% exclude
```
This example would do the following:
- The Imposter Power will stay completely active once obtained.
- The United we Stand Power is acquired and permanently active.
- The Screw the Rules Power is a requirement for globally activating the powers in Dirtmouth/King's Pass but itself does nothing.
- The True Form ability can be acquired as normal but it will not be a requirement to fully enable the Dirtmouth/King's Pass powers globally.

You can ignore a line if you insert a "#" somewhere in the line.
